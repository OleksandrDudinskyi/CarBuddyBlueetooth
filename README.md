# CarBuddyBlueetooth
Basic application is CarBuddyApp. At first I thought to develop two apps one for beacons and second for users, but
then realized that it's redundant. As beacon you can mark any device, like paired or not paired devices, and use
only their specifications to identify their in appropriate range or not.

In Car Buddy app user can select car and wallet as beacons, also minimum range for beacons (within this range 
beacon counting as is with you) and update frequency time settings can be define. Then start monitoring, in case 
user will be near the car in the range satisfies the criteria, and wallet will be unreachable or very far from user,
notification about it will be received.
